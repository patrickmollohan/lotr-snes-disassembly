Thats all I've done so far. When I update it I may add some codes for Aragorn
and Gandolf!

--------------------------
BUGS
--------------------------
I've only run across a few bugs so far.

1. The All Key Items codes basically erase the events, meaning you'll miss some
of the story.
(EG. If you already have the item a character is requesting, they wont ask for
it and you can just give them it.)

2. The Text box gets alittle choppy, and some graphics overlay, but you can
still see whats being said. It's just alittle annoying.

3. The Gold Pieces on the have all items codes dont give you max gold, just
show up on the items menu.

4. You have to reset the game to enable the "ITEM" codes(I hacked these codes
on an Emulator)!
